# Two-Sum-II---Input-Array-Is-Sorted
Given a 1-indexed, non-decreasing sorted array numbers, find two numbers such that they sum to a given target. Return their 1-based indices [index1, index2] where index1 &lt; index2. Only one solution exists. You cannot use the same element twice. Use constant extra space.
